# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying due to configuration problems.

## Bug Description

The issue is that the Tailwind CSS classes specified in the HTML are not being applied to the elements. This is usually caused by incorrect or missing `@tailwind` directives in the main CSS file.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies if any are used.
3. Run the application.
4. Observe that the Tailwind CSS classes do not have their styles applied correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `@tailwind` directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) are present in the main CSS file, correctly configured and in the proper order.  Check also for any typos in your class names.
